          <h1>Personal Project</h1>
          <p>This is one of the most impactful coding adventure I went on. I started with virtually no knowledge about pygame and ended up with a fantastic game!</p>
          <h3>Quick Explanation:</h3>
          <p>My final product was a game combining elements of a platformer and a shooter game. This game has 6 levels, dialogues that sum up to over one thousand words, UI, and most of the components you expect from a game. Since it is inspired by platformers such as Mario and shooter games, it includes mechanics such as shooting, healing, collecting coins and a timer system to stop you from wandering around the level. A permanent death system occurs when you lose all your health, but it still allows you to keep all your coins. If you fall into the void in a level, you return to the level selecting the menu at the cost of 10 coins.</p>

                These are some examples of my code and me testing my game.

                This process journal entry is close to the final project deadline so the game is basically complete.
                <br>
                I edited the ui, the main file, how the level works and how the saving system works.

              <p>
                My coding journey wasn't all that smooth. I encountered a range of bugs and unfamiliar situations
                <br>
                which I dealt with as best as I can. Here is an example of me adding and adjusting a new feature
                <br>
                (a timer) and I tried my best to fix it, which took quite some time. This example was actually
                <br>
                quite a simple bug and everything went quite smoothly.

                Here is the itch.io page that I created for my personal project. It was my first experience
                <br>
                creating a page for my coding projects and it was quite interesting to use. You could access
                <br>
                this website through the links in my personal project (<a href="#pp">press here</a>).
